\section{Introduction}

The following document outlines the proposal for Chile-based employees to provide out of hours technical support to Rubin's infrastructure.
This includes assisting the observatory through unexpected technical issues during on-sky nighttime observations.
Out of hours support includes events triggered before or after the standard working hours in Chile, also known as the ``day shift''.
Specifically, out of hours support starts on weekdays at 17:30 and ends the following day at 8:30, and spans the entire 24 hours of weekends and holidays.

This document covers the Chilean workers with respect to compensation for out of hours support.  
On-call compensation is 10\% times the hourly wage for the duration of an official on-call shift.  This increases to 100\% times the hourly wage if the person is called to work out of hours time.

AURA exempt employees are permitted to work out of hours, as long as the hours keep to the timecard allotment of 80 hours per two-week time period.  AURA employees do not receive compensation for working overtime.
The compensation aspects in this document applies to exempt/salaried employees.
