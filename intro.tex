\section{Introduction}

The following document outlines the proposal to provide out of hours support to Rubin's infrastructure by all the subsystem teams in order to assist the observatory through technical issues during on-sky nighttime observations.  The teams include the DM DevOps team as well as support across Technical teams.

Out of hours support includes events triggered before or after the standard working hours in Chile, also known as the `day shift'. Therefore out of hours support starts on weekdays at 17:30 and ends the next day at 8:30, and runs 24 hours on weekends and holidays.  Out of hours support covers the time period of the `swing shift' and `night shift'.

This document covers the Chilean union workers with respect to compensation for out of hours support.  AURA exempt employees are permitted to work out of hours, as long as the hours keep to the timecard allotment of 80 hours per two-week time period.  The compensation aspects in this document do not apply to AURA exempt/salaried employees.
